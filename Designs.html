				✨⛓️Andrómeda Shun⛓️✨<br>
				Will Shun be the most powerful bronze knight? There is a lot of debate about it but there is no doubt that it has the strongest technique.
				Shun is a very empathetic person who hates fighting and hurting others, which is why it has cost him many times to receive great beatings, but not
				for lack of power but for remaining stoic in the face of his principles.<br>
				Throughout the manga and anime we can see that Shun was maturing in his fighting style at first using his Andromeda Chains in
				defensively or passively neutralizing his enemies, trying to get his opponents to surrender without taking too much damage, but then
				From the terrible battle of the 12 houses we can see how Shun no longer hesitates to use his Nebular Storm if necessary to defeat his enemies.
				Without a doubt, he is a Saint with a big heart, but this quality is not a weakness, but his greatest strength!</div>

				"Gemini saga ♊ the saint with two faces🎭"<br>
				Despite being one of the most powerful and respected in Athena's sanctuary, Saga hid a dark secret, his dual personality.
				On the one hand, he was a noble, wise, big-hearted and dedicated saint, but when his evil personality possessed him, his whole vision and values ​​were completely distorted, leading him to commit terrible crimes following a distorted concept of justice.
				After the great battle of the 12 zodiacal houses before dying, Saga purged his dark side completely, finally freeing himself from that terrible duality that tormented him.
				I think that even after Saga redeemed himself, he never stopped suffering and feeling guilty for his sins.
				He is a melancholic saint who hides his tears behind his unwavering countenance.
				In this image Saga is wearing his gold cloth and his Spectral Surplice. </div>
