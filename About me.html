	  		<div class="texto1">Drawing is my passion since I have memory. 
			I have a special relationship with art in almost all of its expressions; 
			I enjoy creating things. When I was a kid, I used to have a lot of toys and had a good time playing with them. 
			However, what I loved the most was to create my own robots, spaceships, and creatures. 
			Particularly, I remember using a wire for an articulated structure and some kind of epoxy putty to build armors and the main body. 
			As a teenager, I started painting in oil and acrylics, which was a new way to express my artistic needs. 
			As I grew up, I made more complex creations; like crafts, lamps, and decorative objects for my own house. 
			Moreover, I have my cosplayer side, crafting armors, swords, helmets, masks in Eva foam or wood, plastic, and other materials (I am the guy everybody asks for help on Halloween, ha-ha). 
			Nevertheless, my real passion is to draw, especially manga style. 
			It’s like therapy. When I draw, my world changes and everything becomes possible. 
			Things have a different color and perspective.</div>

			<div class="texto2">Life took me through a lot of paths, sometimes very far away from my passion. 
			To be stuck in “reality” and having several jobs in simultaneous becomes a problem when you try to do what you really enjoy.
			Like many people, I found myself trapped in that reality for several years. 
			Then the pandemic apocalypse appeared in our lives, and that changed everything. 
			It was very tough for the whole world, but I like to think that sometimes hard experiences help you realize and understand certain things about yourself and your life. I realized I stopped developing my art because I couldn’t find time to do it, and that was a wrong choice. 
			What is life if you don’t do what you love? Nothing is more important than that, and if you don’t have the time, you create it, you find a way. 
			That was the lesson that these pandemic years left me. 
			And I’m here starting from zero learning new drawing techniques and enjoying what I love the most. 
			I truly believe no one is too old to start again with something. 
			It doesn’t matter how late you started if you do.
			So, let’s get to work and enjoy this creation process. Wish me luck! :D</div>
